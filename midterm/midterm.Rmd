# Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

![Vestibulo-ocular reflex](images/vor.png)^[http://bit.ly/19GjJOA]

**Vestibulo-ocular reflex** (VOR) adaptation is one of the most studied cerebellar dependent motor learning tasks. It is used to provide insight about the connections and the coding of the circuitry of the cerebellum.

# Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

![Vestibulo-ocular reflex](images/vor.png)^[http://bit.ly/19GjJOA]

This reflex functions to **stabilize images** on the retinas during **head movement** by producing **eye movements** in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field.

# Problem statement

> Computational models of the vestibulo-ocular reflex don't take into account the role of the nucleo-olivary inhibition

![Cerebellar microcircuit](images/nrn2332-f3.jpg)^[http://bit.ly/1AVg1qX]

# Nucleo-olivary inhibition (NOI)

On the neuroanatomical circuitries and sites of cellular plasticity underlying adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex there's a pathway that provides feedback for adjustment of the learning instruction.

It is formed by GABAergic neurons that innervate the neurons in the inferior olive from which the climbing fibres originate [@DeZeeuw2005]

* NOI __is not__ present on computational models of the VOR
* NOI __is__ present on __eye-blink__ reflex computational models

# Trade-offs in avoidance actions

![Ali vs Foreman](images/ali.png)

# Extinction and NOI

- Cost-optimization
- Error-based learning
- Control the gain of the cerebellar output
- Acquired conditioned responses are extinguished once they become no longer necessary

[@Herreros2013b]

# Research question

What's the role of the nucleo-olivary inhibition in the vestibulo-ocular reflex?

## Fingerprints
- NOI has a role in the eye-blink reflex
- There is extinction of the adaptive response in the absence of peripheral error
- VOR has a non-perfect performance, with a residual error proportional to the amount of cerebellar action required

[@Herreros2013b]

# Hypothesis

Adding nucleo-olivary inhibition in the vestibulo-cerebellum explains extinction in the state of the art vestibulo-ocular reflex computational models.

# Computational models of the VOR

- Marr-Albus-Ito classical models
- The cerebellum as an adaptive filter
- Plasticity on the brainstem
- A detailed model

# Marr-Albus-Ito classical models

![Marr-Albus-Ito](images/ito.png)^[http://bit.ly/1ED2SEc]

[@Ito2006]

# Marr-Albus-Ito classical models

- Two very differents signals affect indirectly the output of the cerebellum
- Simple and complex spikes
- Plasticity at the parallel fibre to Purkinje cell synapses
- Climbing fibre (teaching signal or error): retinal slip
- Long-term depression (LTD)

# The cerebellum as an adaptive filter

![](images/adfilt.png)

[@Dean2010]

# The cerebellum as an adaptive filter

- Feed-forward system
- Motor error problem
- Decorrelation rule
- Minimizes correlations between eye movements as a predictor variable and retinal slip as a target variable
- Climbing fibre signal delayed, prevents perfect decorrelation

# Plasticity on the brainstem

- Plasticity in both cerebellar cortex and the brainstem
- Instructive signals in the climbing fibers are not necessary for cerebellum-dependent learning
- Instructive signals from climbing fibers or Purkinje cell simple spikes may be sufficient to induce motor learning

[@Ke2009a]

- Cortex-first
- Simple gain

[@Porrill2007]

# A detailed model

- Contribution of interneurons are added

- Plasticity on the cerebellar cortex
$$\dot{w}_{PG_i}(t) = [ \alpha_{PG}( \nu_{CF}-C(t)) +  \sqrt{ \alpha_{PG}}  \sigma  \xi (t)]G(t)$$

- Plasticity on the brainstem
$$\dot{w}_{VM}(t) = \alpha_{VM}(M_0-M(t))(P(t)-P_ini(t))$$

# Adding the NOI to the detailed mode

Modulation in the dark of the teaching signal

- Modulated by vestibular information [@Clopath2014]
$$C(t) = \nu_{CF} - L(V(t- \delta) - V_t(t-\delta)) - H(M(t) - M_0)$$

- Modulated by cortical information
$$C(t) = \nu_{CF} - L(V(t- \delta) - V_t(t-\delta)) - H(kP(t))$$
