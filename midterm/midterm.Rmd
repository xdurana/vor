# Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

![Vestibulo-ocular reflex](images/vor.png)^[http://bit.ly/19GjJOA]

**Vestibulo-ocular reflex** (VOR) adaptation is one of the most studied cerebellar dependent motor learning tasks. It is used to provide insight about the connections and the coding of the circuitry of the cerebellum.

# Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

![Vestibulo-ocular reflex](images/vor.png)^[http://bit.ly/19GjJOA]

This reflex functions to **stabilize images** on the retinas during **head movement** by producing **eye movements** in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field.

# Problem statement

> Computational models of the vestibulo-ocular reflex don't take into account the role of the nucleo-olivary inhibition

![Cerebellar microcircuit](images/nrn2332-f3.jpg)^[http://bit.ly/1AVg1qX]

# Nucleo-olivary inhibition (NOI)

On the neuroanatomical circuitries and sites of cellular plasticity underlying adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex there's a pathway that provides feedback for adjustment of the learning instruction.

It is formed by GABAergic neurons that innervate the neurons in the inferior olive from which the climbing fibres originate [@DeZeeuw2005]

* NOI __is not__ present on computational models of the VOR
* NOI __is__ present on __eye-blink__ reflex computational models

# Trade-offs in avoidance actions

![Ali vs Foreman](images/ali.png)

# Extinction and NOI

- Cost-optimization
- Error-based learning
- Control the gain of the cerebellar output
- Acquired conditioned responses are extinguished once they become no longer necessary

[@Herreros2013b]

# Research question

What's the role of the nucleo-olivary inhibition in the vestibulo-ocular reflex?

## Fingerprints
- NOI has a role in the eye-blink reflex
- There is extinction of the adaptive response in the absence of peripheral error
- VOR has a non-perfect performance, with a residual error proportional to the amount of cerebellar action required

[@Herreros2013b]

# Hypothesis

Adding nucleo-olivary inhibition in the vestibulo-cerebellum explains extinction in the state of the art vestibulo-ocular reflex computational models.

# Computational models of the VOR

- Marr-Albus-Ito classical models
- The cerebellum as an adaptive filter
- Plasticity on the brainstem
- A detailed model

# Adding the NOI to the detailed mode

Modulation in the dark of the teaching signal

- Modulated by vestibular information
$$C(t) = \nu_{CF} - L(V(t- \delta) - V_t(t-\delta)) - H(M(t) - M_0)$$

- Modulated by cortical information
$$C(t) = \nu_{CF} - L(V(t- \delta) - V_t(t-\delta)) - H(kP(t))$$

# Project planning

# Where we are now

- Detailed model [@Clopath2014] implemented in Matlab
- Results reproduced as on the article
- NOI added to the model

# Future work

* Analyze detailed model assumptions
    + What are the effects of clipping weights on the PF-PC synapses?
    + Identify other assumptions of the detailed model
* Comparing detailed and NOI models
    + Do they show linear or exponential decay after one week light deprivation?
    + What does maintaining the training to the cortex-nuclei memory balance?
