Localized infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol were used to target putative consolidation processes by producing reversible inactivations after NMR conditioning sessions. Posttraining inactivations of eyeblink control regions in cerebellar cortical lobule HVI completely prevented conditioning from developing over four sessions. In contrast, similar inactivations of eyeblink control regions in the cerebellar nuclei allowed conditioning to develop normally. These findings provide evidence that there are critical posttraining memory consolidation processes for eyeblink conditioning mediated by the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {The cerebellum fine-tunes motor activity via its Purkinje cell output. Purkinje cells produce two different types of spikes, complex spikes and simple spikes, which often show reciprocal activity:Â a periodical increase in complex spikes is associated with a decrease in simple spikes, and vice versa. This reciprocal firing is thought to be essential for coordinated motor behavior, yet how it is accomplished is debated. Here, we show in Ptf1a::cre;Robo3(lox/lox) mice that selectively rerouting the climbing fibers from a contralateral to an ipsilateral projection reversed the complex-spike modulation during sensory stimulation. Strikingly, modulation of simple spikes, which is supposed to be controlled by mossy fibers, reversed as well. Climbing fibers enforce this reciprocity in part by influencing activity of inhibitory interneurons, because the phase of their activity was also converted. Ptf1a::cre;Robo3(lox/lox) mice showed severe ataxia highlighting that climbing fiber input and its impact on reciprocity of Purkinje cell firing play an important role in motor coordination.},

abstract = {The output signal of Purkinje cells is conveyed by the modulated discharge of simple spikes (SSs) often ascribed to mossy fiber-granule cell-parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cell dendrites. Although generally accepted, this view lacks experimental support. We can address this view by controlling afferent signals that reach the cerebellum over climbing and mossy fiber pathways. Vestibular primary afferents constitute the largest mossy fiber projection to the uvula-nodulus. The discharge of vestibular primary afferent mossy fibers increases during ipsilateral roll tilt. The discharge of SSs decreases during ipsilateral roll tilt. Climbing fiber discharge [complex spikes (CSs)] increases during ipsilateral roll tilt. These observations suggest that the modulation of SSs during vestibular stimulation cannot be attributed directly to vestibular mossy fiber afferents. Rather we suggest that interneurons driven by vestibular climbing fibers may determine SS modulation. We recorded from cerebellar interneurons (granule, unipolar brush, Golgi, stellate, basket, and Lugaro cells) and Purkinje cells in the uvula-nodulus of anesthetized mice during vestibular stimulation. We identified all neuronal types by juxtacellular labeling with neurobiotin. Granule, unipolar brush, stellate, and basket cells discharge in phase with ipsilateral roll tilt and in phase with CSs. Golgi cells discharge out of phase with ipsilateral roll tilt and out of phase with CSs. The phases of stellate and basket cell discharge suggests that their activity could account for the antiphasic behavior of CSs and SSs. Because Golgi cells discharge in phase with SSs, Golgi cell activity cannot account for SS modulation. The sagittal array of Golgi cell axon terminals suggests that they contribute to the organization of discrete parasagittal vestibular zones.},

@article{Belmeguenai2010a,
abstract = {Synaptic gain control and information storage in neural networks are mediated by alterations in synaptic transmission, such as in long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we show using both in vitro and in vivo recordings from the rat cerebellum that tetanization protocols for the induction of LTP at parallel fiber (PF)-to-Purkinje cell synapses can also evoke increases in intrinsic excitability. This form of intrinsic plasticity shares with LTP a requirement for the activation of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B for induction. Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity resembles CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell intrinsic plasticity in that it requires activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) and is mediated by a downregulation of SK-type calcium-sensitive K conductances. In addition, Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity similarly results in enhanced spine calcium signaling. However, there are fundamental differences: first, while in the hippocampus increases in excitability result in a higher probability for LTP induction, intrinsic plasticity in Purkinje cells lowers the probability for subsequent LTP induction. Second, intrinsic plasticity raises the spontaneous spike frequency of Purkinje cells. The latter effect does not impair tonic spike firing in the target neurons of inhibitory Purkinje cell projections in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but lowers the Purkinje cell signal-to-noise ratio, thus reducing the PF readout. These observations suggest that intrinsic plasticity accompanies LTP of active PF synapses, while it reduces at weaker, nonpotentiated synapses the probability for subsequent potentiation and lowers the impact on the Purkinje cell output.},

@article{Blazquez2004,
abstract = {Motor systems are under a continuous adaptive process to maintain behavior throughout developmental changes and disease, a process called motor learning. Simple behaviors with easily measurable inputs and outputs are best suited to understand the neuronal signals that contribute to the required motor learning. Considering simple behaviors, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) allows quantification of its input and motor output and its neural circuitry is among the best documented. The main candidates for plastic change are the cerebellum and its target neurons in the brainstem. This review focuses on recent data regarding the involvement of the cerebellum in VOR motor learning. Learning can be divided into that acutely acquired over a period of hours and that chronically acquired over longer periods. Both acute and chronic learning have three phases named acquisition, consolidation, and retention. The cerebellar role in retention is disputed, but there is a consensus on the need of an intact cerebellum for acquisition. Data from neuronal recording, lesion studies and transgenic mouse experiments is complex but suggests that the signal representation in the cerebellum contains aspects of both motor output and sensory input. The cerebellum apparently uses different mechanisms for acute and chronic learning as well as for increases and decreases in VOR gain. Recent studies also suggest that the signal content in the cerebellum changes following learning and that the mechanisms used for chronic adaptation involve not only changes in a head velocity component but also in the efference copy of an eye movement command signal reaching Purkinje cells. This data leads to a new conceptual framework having implications for developing theories on the role of the cerebellum in motor learning and in the search for plastic elements within the VOR circuitry. For chronic learning we hypothesize that changes in the head velocity information traveling through the circuitry occur in parallel with changes in the integrator pathway and the efference copy pathway. We further propose that these changes are necessary to maintain the broadband characteristics of the learned behavior.},

abstract = {Plastic changes in the efficacy of synapses are widely regarded to represent mechanisms underlying memory formation. So far, evidence for learning-dependent, new neuronal wiring is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that pavlovian eyeblink conditioning in adult mice can induce robust axonal growth and synapse formation in the cerebellar nuclei. This de novo wiring is both condition specific and region specific because it does not occur in pseudoconditioned animals and is particularly observed in those parts of the cerebellar nuclei that have been implicated to be involved in this form of motor learning. Moreover, the number of new mossy fiber varicosities in these parts of the cerebellar nuclei is positively correlated with the amplitude of conditioned eyelid responses. These results indicate that outgrowth of axons and concomitant occurrence of new terminals may, in addition to plasticity of synaptic efficacy, contribute to the formation of memory.},

@article{Bower2010,
abstract = {For most of the last 50 years, the functional interpretation for inhibition in cerebellar cortical circuitry has been dominated by the relatively simple notion that excitatory and inhibitory dendritic inputs sum, and if that sum crosses threshold at the soma the Purkinje cell generates an action potential. Thus, inhibition has traditionally been relegated to a role of sculpting, restricting, or blocking excitation. At the level of networks, this relatively simply notion is manifest in mechanisms like "surround inhibition" which is purported to "shape" or "tune" excitatory neuronal responses. In the cerebellum, where all cell types except one (the granule cell) are inhibitory, these assumptions regarding the role of inhibition continue to dominate. Based on our recent series of modeling and experimental studies, we now suspect that inhibition may play a much more complex, subtle, and central role in the physiological and functional organization of cerebellar cortex. This paper outlines how model-based studies are changing our thinking about the role of feed-forward molecular layer inhibition in the cerebellar cortex. The results not only have important implications for continuing efforts to understand what the cerebellum computes, but might also reveal important features of the evolution of this large and quintessentially vertebrate brain structure.},

abstract = {The cerebellum is an evolutionarily conserved structure critical for motor learning in vertebrates. The model that has influenced much of the work in the field for the past 30 years suggests that motor learning is mediated by a single plasticity mechanism in the cerebellum: long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. However, recent studies of simple behaviors such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) indicate that multiple plasticity mechanisms contribute to cerebellum-dependent learning. Multiple plasticity mechanisms may provide the flexibility required to store memories over different timescales, regulate the dynamics of movement, and allow bidirectional changes in movement amplitude. These plasticity mechanisms must act in combination with appropriate information-coding strategies to equip motor-learning systems with the ability to express learning in correct contexts. Studies of the patterns of generalization of motor learning in the VOR provide insight about the coding of information in neurons at sites of plasticity. These principles emerging from studies of the VOR are consistent with results concerning more complex behaviors and thus may reflect general principles of cerebellar function.},

Purkinje cells target the deep cerebellar nuclei, which are the output of the cerebellum and include an inhibitory GABAergic projection to the inferior olive. This pathway identifies a potential closed loop in the olivo-cortico-nuclear network. Therefore, sets of Purkinje cells may phasically control their own climbing fiber afferents. Here, using in vitro and in vivo recordings, we describe a genetically modified mouse model that allows the specific optogenetic control of Purkinje cell discharge. Tetrode recordings in the cerebellar nuclei demonstrate that focal stimulations of Purkinje cells strongly inhibit spatially restricted sets of cerebellar nuclear neurons. Strikingly, such stimulations trigger delayed climbing-fiber input signals in the stimulated Purkinje cells. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Purkinje cells phasically control the discharge of their own olivary afferents and thus might participate in the regulation of cerebellar motor learning.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of cerebellar motor learning are still poorly understood. The standard Marr-Albus-Ito theory posits that learning involves plasticity at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses under control of the climbing fiber input, which provides an error signal as in classical supervised learning paradigms. However, a growing body of evidence challenges this theory, in that additional sites of plasticity appear to contribute to motor adaptation. Here, we consider phase-reversal training of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), a simple form of motor learning for which a large body of experimental data is available in wild-type and mutant mice, in which the excitability of granule cells or inhibition of Purkinje cells was affected in a cell-specific fashion. We present novel electrophysiological recordings of Purkinje cell activity measured in naive wild-type mice subjected to this VOR adaptation task. We then introduce a minimal model that consists of learning at the parallel fibers to Purkinje cells with the help of the climbing fibers. Although the minimal model reproduces the behavior of the wild-type animals and is analytically tractable, it fails at reproducing the behavior of mutant mice and the electrophysiology data. Therefore, we build a detailed model involving plasticity at the parallel fibers to Purkinje cells' synapse guided by climbing fibers, feedforward inhibition of Purkinje cells, and plasticity at the mossy fiber to vestibular nuclei neuron synapse. The detailed model reproduces both the behavioral and electrophysiological data of both the wild-type and mutant mice and allows for experimentally testable predictions.},

abstract = {Motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and eyeblink conditioning use similar neural circuitry, and they may use similar cellular plasticity mechanisms. Classically conditioned eyeblink responses undergo extinction after prolonged exposure to the conditioned stimulus in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. We investigated the possibility that a process similar to extinction may reverse learned changes in the VOR. We induced a learned alteration of the VOR response in rhesus monkeys using magnifying or miniaturizing goggles, which caused head movements to be accompanied by visual image motion. After learning, head movements in the absence of visual stimulation caused a loss of the learned eye movement response. When the learned gain was low, this reversal of learning occurred only when head movements were delivered, and not when the head was held stationary in the absence of visual input, suggesting that this reversal is mediated by an active, extinction-like process.},

This memory undergoes a period of consolidation after the training session, when it is sensitive to reversible inactivations of the cerebellar cortex, but not of the cerebellar nuclei, with the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. Here, the temporal properties of this cerebellar cortex-dependent consolidation were examined using delayed infusions of muscimol in cortical lobule HVI. Cortical infusions delayed by 5 or 45 min after a conditioning session produced significant and very similar impairments of consolidation, but infusions delayed by 90 min produced little or no impairment. Behavioral measures indicate that the muscimol infusions produced significant effects after approximately 30 min and they lasted for a few hours. So, over a time window beginning approximately 1 hr after the end of the training session and closing 1 hr after that, intracortical activity is critical for consolidation of this motor memory.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of cerebellar research is going to clarify several aspects of cellular and circuit physiology. However, the concepts about cerebellar mechanisms of function are still largely related to clinical observations and to models elaborated before the last discoveries appeared. In this paper, the major issues are revisited, suggesting that previous concepts can now be refined and modified. The cerebellum is fundamentally involved in timing and in controlling the ordered and precise execution of motor sequences. The fast reaction of the cerebellum to the inputs is sustained by specific cellular mechanisms ensuring precision on the millisecond scale. These include burst-burst reconversion in the granular layer and instantaneous frequency modulation on the 100-Hz band in Purkinje and deep cerebellar nuclei cells. Precisely timed signals can be used for perceptron operations in Purkinje cells and to establish appropriate correlations with climbing fiber signals inducing learning at parallel fiber synapses. In the granular layer, plasticity turns out to be instrumental to timing, providing a conceptual solution to the discrepancy between cerebellar learning and timing. The granular layer sub-circuit can be tuned by long-term synaptic plasticity and synaptic inhibition to delay the incoming signals over a 100-ms range. For longer sequences, large circuit sections can be entrained into coherent activity in 100-ms cycles. These dynamic aspects, which have not been accounted for by original theories, could in fact represent the essence of cerebellar functioning. It is suggested that the cerebellum can, in this way, operate the realignment of temporally incongruent signals, allowing their binding and pattern recognition in Purkinje cells. The demonstration of these principles, their behavioral relevance and their relationship with internal model theories represent a challenge for future cerebellar research.},

abstract = {Following the fundamental recognition of its involvement in sensory-motor coordination and learning, the cerebellum is now also believed to take part in the processing of cognition and emotion. This hypothesis is recurrent in numerous papers reporting anatomical and functional observations, and it requires an explanation. We argue that a similar circuit structure in all cerebellar areas may carry out various operations using a common computational scheme. On the basis of a broad review of anatomical data, it is conceivable that the different roles of the cerebellum lie in the specific connectivity of the cerebellar modules, with motor, cognitive, and emotional functions (at least partially) segregated into different cerebro-cerebellar loops. We here develop a conceptual and operational framework based on multiple interconnected levels (a meta-levels hypothesis): from cellular/molecular to network mechanisms leading to generation of computational primitives, thence to high-level cognitive/emotional processing, and finally to the sphere of mental function and dysfunction. The main concept explored is that of intimate interplay between timing and learning (reminiscent of the "timing and learning machine" capabilities long attributed to the cerebellum), which reverberates from cellular to circuit mechanisms. Subsequently, integration within large-scale brain loops could generate the disparate cognitive/emotional and mental functions in which the cerebellum has been implicated. We propose, therefore, that the cerebellum operates as a general-purpose co-processor, whose effects depend on the specific brain centers to which individual modules are connected. Abnormal functioning in these loops could eventually contribute to the pathogenesis of major brain pathologies including not just ataxia but also dyslexia, autism, schizophrenia, and depression.},

abstract = {The dorsal cap of the inferior olive is involved in the control of eye movements and is excited by inputs from the midbrain. In the present study we attempted to determine the inhibitory input to this nucleus in rat and rabbit. The projection from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi to the dorsal cap was studied in the light microscope by anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and lesion-induced depletion of glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity, and in the electron microscope by anterograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin-coupled horseradish peroxidase combined with GABA immunocytochemistry. We show that the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi projects bilaterally to the dorsal cap, contralaterally to the ventrolateral outgrowth, and ipsilaterally to the medial accessory olive. After lesioning of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the caudal dorsal cap was depleted of most of its glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive terminals while the rostral dorsal cap and the ventrolateral outgrowth were depleted of a minor part. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the majority, but not all, of the terminals from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in the dorsal cap are GABA-positive. These GABA-positive and GABA-negative terminals form predominantly symmetric and asymmetric synapses; most of them synapse on dendrites outside and inside glomeruli, frequently in association with dendrodendritic gap junctions, while a small minority are axosomatic. None of the terminals from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi was found to form a crest synapse, although synapses of this kind were predominantly formed by GABAergic terminals. This study shows that the dorsal cap receives a major inhibitory input from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the terminals of which are located at strategic positions on the olivary neurons.},

There are several possible molecular and cellular mechanisms that could underlie adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and eyeblink conditioning. Although causal relationships between particular cellular processes and individual components of a learned behaviour have not been demonstrated unequivocally, an overall picture is emerging that the different types and sites of cellular plasticity relate importantly to the stage of learning and/or its temporal specifics.},

abstract = {The adaptive-filter model of the cerebellar microcircuit is in widespread use, combining as it does an explanation of key microcircuit features with well-specified computational power. Here we consider two methods for its evaluation. One is to test its predictions concerning relations between cerebellar inputs and outputs. Where the relevant experimental data are available, e.g. for the floccular role in image stabilization, the predictions appear to be upheld. However, for the majority of cerebellar microzones these data have yet to be obtained. The second method is to test model predictions about details of the microcircuit. We focus on features apparently incompatible with the model, in particular non-linear patterns in Purkinje cell simple-spike firing. Analysis of these patterns suggests the following three conclusions. (i) It is important to establish whether they can be observed during task-related behaviour. (ii) Highly non-linear models based on these patterns are unlikely to be universal, because they would be incompatible with the (approximately) linear nature of floccular function. (iii) The control tasks for which these models are computationally suited need to be identified. At present, therefore, the adaptive filter remains a candidate model of at least some cerebellar microzones, and its evaluation suggests promising lines for future enquiry.},

abstract = {Motor adaptation to a novel dynamic environment is primarily thought of as a process in which the nervous system learns to anticipate the environmental forces to eliminate kinematic error. Here we show that motor adaptation can more generally be modeled as a process in which the motor system greedily minimizes a cost function that is the weighted sum of kinematic error and effort. The learning dynamics predicted by this minimization process are a linear, auto-regressive equation with only one state, which has been identified previously as providing a good fit to data from force-field-type experiments. Thus we provide a new theoretical result that shows how these previously identified learning dynamics can be viewed as arising from an optimization of error and effort. We also show that the coefficients of the learning dynamics must fall within a specific range for the optimization model to be valid and verify with experimental data from walking in a force field that they indeed fall in this range. Finally, we attempted to falsify the model by performing experiments in two conditions (repeated exposure to a force field, exposure to force fields of different strengths) for which the single-state, auto-regressive equation might be expected to not fit the data well. We found however that the equation adequately captured the pattern of errors and thus conclude that motor adaptation to a force field can be approximated as an optimization of effort and error for a range of experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Image stability during self-motion is achieved via a combination of the optokinetic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes (OKR and VOR). To determine whether distinct neuronal mechanisms are used to calibrate eye movements driven by visual and vestibular signals, we examined the developmental maturation and adaptive plasticity of the OKR and VOR in mice. The combined performance of the OKR and VOR, measured with infrared video oculography, produces nearly perfect gaze stability both in adult mice and in juveniles (postnatal days 21-26). Analyses of the OKR and VOR in isolation, however, indicate that VOR gains in juveniles are lower than in adult mice, while OKR gains are higher, indicating that juveniles rely more strongly on vision to stabilize gaze than do adults. Adaptive plasticity in the mouse OKR and VOR could be induced by 30 min of visual-vestibular mismatch training. Examination of the effects of training on the OKR and VOR revealed differential mechanisms and persistence of adaptive plasticity. Increases in VOR gain induced by rotating mice in the opposite direction to the visual surround were short-lasting and were accompanied by long-lasting increases in OKR gain. In contrast, decreases in VOR gain induced by rotating mice in the same direction as the visual surround were persistent and were accompanied by long-lasting increases in OKR gain. Vestibular training had little effect on either the OKR or VOR, while visual training induced robust and long-lasting increases in the OKR but had no effect on the VOR. These data indicate that multiple mechanisms of plasticity operate over distinct time courses to optimize oculomotor performance in mice.},

This resulted in reduced GC output to Purkinje cells (PCs) and stellate cells (SCs) as well as in impaired long-term plasticity at GC-PC synapses. As a consequence modulation amplitude and regularity of simple spike (SS) output were affected. Surprisingly, the overall motor performance was intact, whereas demanding motor learning and memory consolidation tasks were compromised. Our findings indicate that a minority of functionally intact GCs is sufficient for the maintenance of basic motor performance, whereas acquisition and stabilization of sophisticated memories require higher numbers of normal GCs controlling PC firing.},

abstract = {Studies on synaptic plasticity in the context of learning have been dominated by the view that a single, particular type of plasticity forms the underlying mechanism for a particular type of learning. However, emerging evidence shows that many forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity at different sites are induced conjunctively during procedural memory formation in the cerebellum. Here, we review the main forms of long-term plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that underlie motor learning. We propose that the different forms of plasticity in the granular layer and the molecular layer operate synergistically in a temporally and spatially distributed manner, so as to ultimately create optimal output for behaviour.},

abstract = {Adaptable gain regulation is at the core of the forward controller operation performed by the cerebro-cerebellar loops and it allows the intensity of motor acts to be finely tuned in a predictive manner. In order to learn and store information about body-object dynamics and to generate an internal model of movement, the cerebellum is thought to employ long-term synaptic plasticity. LTD at the PF-PC synapse has classically been assumed to subserve this function (Marr, 1969). However, this plasticity alone cannot account for the broad dynamic ranges and time scales of cerebellar adaptation. We therefore tested the role of plasticity distributed over multiple synaptic sites (Hansel et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2012) by generating an analog cerebellar model embedded into a control loop connected to a robotic simulator. The robot used a three-joint arm and performed repetitive fast manipulations with different masses along an 8-shape trajectory. In accordance with biological evidence, the cerebellum model was endowed with both LTD and LTP at the PF-PC, MF-DCN and PC-DCN synapses. This resulted in a network scheme whose effectiveness was extended considerably compared to one including just PF-PC synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the system including distributed plasticity reliably self-adapted to manipulate different masses and to learn the arm-object dynamics over a time course that included fast learning and consolidation, along the lines of what has been observed in behavioral tests. In particular, PF-PC plasticity operated as a time correlator between the actual input state and the system error, while MF-DCN and PC-DCN plasticity played a key role in generating the gain controller. This model suggests that distributed synaptic plasticity allows generation of the complex learning properties of the cerebellum. The incorporation of further plasticity mechanisms and of spiking signal processing will allow this concept to be extended in a more realistic computational scenario.},

abstract = {The vestibular system provides an attractive model for understanding how changes in cellular and synaptic activity influence learning and memory in a quantifiable behavior, the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The vestibulo-ocular reflex produces eye movements that compensate for head motion; simple yet powerful forms of motor learning calibrate the circuit throughout life. Learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex depends initially on the activity of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar flocculus, but consolidated memories appear to be stored downstream of Purkinje cells, probably in the vestibular nuclei. Recent studies have demonstrated that the neurons of the vestibular nucleus possess the capacity for both synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. Mechanistic analyses of a novel form of firing rate potentiation in neurons of the vestibular nucleus have revealed new rules of plasticity that could apply to spontaneously firing neurons in other parts of the brain. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The vestibular system is vital for motor control and spatial self-motion perception. Afferents from the otolith organs and the semicircular canals converge with optokinetic, somatosensory and motor-related signals in the vestibular nuclei, which are reciprocally interconnected with the vestibulocerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. Here, we review the properties of the many cell types in the vestibular nuclei, as well as some fundamental computations implemented within this brainstem-cerebellar circuitry. These include the sensorimotor transformations for reflex generation, the neural computations for inertial motion estimation, the distinction between active and passive head movements, as well as the integration of vestibular and proprioceptive information for body motion estimation. A common theme in the solution to such computational problems is the concept of internal models and their neural implementation. Recent studies have shed new insights into important organizational principles that closely resemble those proposed for other sensorimotor systems, where their neural basis has often been more difficult to identify. As such, the vestibular system provides an excellent model to explore common neural processing strategies relevant both for reflexive and for goal-directed, voluntary movement as well as perception.},

However, the question of how these two apparently incompatible goals might be achieved by the same cerebellar area remains open. Here we propose a solution where the inhibition of the Inferior Olive (IO) by the cerebellar Deep Nuclei (DN) translates the motor command signal into a sensory prediction allowing a single cerebellar area to simultaneously tackle both aspects of the problem: execution and prediction. We demonstrate that having a graded error signal, the gain of the Nucleo-Olivary Inhibition (NOI) balances the generation of the response between the cerebellar and the reflexive controllers or, in other words, between the adaptive and the reactive layers of behavior. Moreover, we show that the resulting system is fully autonomous and can either acquire or erase adaptive responses according to their utility.},

abstract = {The principal neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN), the sole output of the olivo-cerebellar system, receive a massive inhibitory input from Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellar cortex. Morphological evidence suggests that CN principal cells are also contacted by inhibitory interneurons, but the properties of this connection are unknown. Using transgenic, tracing, and immunohistochemical approaches in mice, we show that CN interneurons form a large heterogeneous population with GABA/glycinergic phenotypes, distinct from GABAergic olive-projecting neurons. CN interneurons are found to contact principal output neurons, via glycine receptor (GlyR)-enriched synapses, virtually devoid of the main GABA receptor (GABAR) subunits $\alpha$1 and $\gamma$2. Those clusters account for 5\% of the total number of inhibitory receptor clusters on principal neurons. Brief optogenetic stimulations of CN interneurons, through selective expression of channelrhodopsin 2 after viral-mediated transfection of the flexed gene in GlyT2-Cre transgenic mice, evoked fast IPSCs in principal cells. GlyR activation accounted for 15\% of interneuron IPSC amplitude, while the remaining current was mediated by activation of GABAR. Surprisingly, small GlyR clusters were also found at PC synapses onto principal CN neurons in addition to $\alpha$1 and $\gamma$2 GABAR subunits. However, GlyR activation was found to account for <3\% of the PC inhibitory synaptic currents evoked by electrical stimulation. This work establishes CN glycinergic neurons as a significant source of inhibition to CN principal cells, forming contacts molecularly distinct from, but functionally similar to, Purkinje cell synapses. Their impact on CN output, motor learning, and motor execution deserves further investigation.},

abstract = {Shortly after John Eccles completed his studies of synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine, he opened another chapter of neuroscience with his work on the cerebellum. From 1963 to 1967, Eccles and his colleagues in Canberra successfully dissected the complex neuronal circuitry in the cerebellar cortex. In the 1967 monograph, "The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine", he, in collaboration with Masao Ito and Janos Szent\'{a}gothai, presented blue-print-like wiring diagrams of the cerebellar neuronal circuitry. These stimulated worldwide discussions and experimentation on the potential operational mechanisms of the circuitry and spurred theoreticians to develop relevant network models of the machinelike function of the cerebellum. In following decades, the neuronal machine concept of the cerebellum was strengthened by additional knowledge of the modular organization of its structure and memory mechanism, the latter in the form of synaptic plasticity, in particular, long-term depression. Moreover, several types of motor control were established as model systems representing learning mechanisms of the cerebellum. More recently, both the quantitative preciseness of cerebellar analyses and overall knowledge about the cerebellum have advanced considerably at the cellular and molecular levels of analysis. Cerebellar circuitry now includes Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells as additional unique elements. Other new revelations include the operation of the complex glomerulus structure, intricate signal transduction for synaptic plasticity, silent synapses, irregularity of spike discharges, temporal fidelity of synaptic activation, rhythm generators, a Golgi cell clock circuit, and sensory or motor representation by mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Furthermore, it has become evident that the cerebellum has cognitive functions, and probably also emotion, as well as better-known motor and autonomic functions. Further cerebellar research is required for full understanding of the cerebellum as a broad learning machine for neural control of these functions.},

CN neurons in slices show intrinsic pacemaking activity, which is easily modulated by synaptic inputs. Our work using dynamic clamping and computer modeling shows that synchronicity between PC inputs is an important factor in determining spike rate and spike timing of CN neurons and that brief pauses in PC inputs provide a potent stimulus to trigger CN spikes. Excitatory input can equally control spike rate, but, due to a large slow, NMDA component also amplifies responses to inhibitory inputs. Intrinsic properties of CN neurons are well suited to provide prolonged responses to strong input transients and could be involved in motor pattern generation. One such specific mechanism is given by fast and slow rebound bursting. Nevertheless, we are just beginning to unravel synaptic integration in the CN, and the outcome of the work to date is best characterized by the generation of new specific questions that lend themselves to a combined experimental and computer modeling approach in future studies.},

abstract = {Associative learning in the cerebellum underlies motor memories and probably also cognitive associations. Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, a widely used experimental model of such learning, depends on the cerebellum, but the memory locus within the cerebellum as well as the underlying mechanisms have remained controversial. To date, crucial information on how cerebellar Purkinje cells change their activity during learning has been ambiguous and contradictory, and there is no information at all about how they behave during extinction and reacquisition. We have now tracked the activity of single Purkinje cells with microelectrodes for up to 16 h in decerebrate ferrets during learning, extinction, and relearning. We demonstrate that paired peripheral forelimb and periocular stimulation, as well as paired direct stimulation of cerebellar afferent pathways (mossy and climbing fibers) consistently causes a gradual acquisition of an inhibitory response in Purkinje cell simple spike firing. This conditioned cell response has several properties that matches known features of the behavioral conditioned response. The response latency varies with the interstimulus interval, and the response maximum is adaptively timed to precede the unconditioned stimulus. Across training trials, it matches behavioral extinction to unpaired stimulation and also the substantial savings that occur when paired stimulation is reinstated. These data suggest that many of the basic behavioral phenomena in eyeblink conditioning can be explained at the level of the single Purkinje cell.},

In the cerebellum this interest has been paired with successes in obtaining recordings from these neurons in vivo and genetic manipulations to probe their function during behavioral tasks such as motor learning. This review focuses on a synthesis of recent findings on the computational properties that these neurons confer to the cerebellar circuitry and on their recently discovered capacity for plasticity and learning in vivo. Since the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex is relatively well-defined, the specificity with which the potential roles of these interneurons can be described will help to guide new avenues of research on the functions of interneurons in general.},

abstract = {Information storage in neural circuits depends on activity-dependent alterations in synaptic weights, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Bidirectional synaptic plasticity endows synapses with mechanisms for rapid reversibility, but it remains unclear how it correlates with reversibility in behavioral learning and whether there is a universal synaptic memory mechanism that operates similarly at all types of synapses. A recently discovered postsynaptic form of LTP at cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses provides a reversal mechanism for PF-LTD and enables a fresh look at the implications of bidirectional plasticity in a brain structure that is particularly suitable to correlate cellular to behavioral learning events. Here, we will review recent studies that reveal unique properties of bidirectional cerebellar plasticity and suggest that the induction cascades for cerebellar LTP and LTD provide a mirror image of their counterparts at hippocampal synapses. We will also discuss how PF-LTP helps to explain reversibility observed in cerebellar motor learning.},

@article{Kassardjian2005,
abstract = {The basis for the consolidation of memory is a controversial topic, particularly in the case of motor memory. One view is that motor memory is transferred, partially or completely, to a new location during the consolidation process ("systems consolidation"). We investigated this possibility in a primitive motor system, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). In the simple circuitry of the VOR, there are relatively few possible storage sites for memory. We partially blocked excitatory neurotransmission in the cerebellar cortex of cats with the glutamate antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). If CNQX was injected immediately after 60 min of rotation under conditions that induced a learned decrease in the gain of the VOR, gain was returned to its baseline value. Expression of the new memory could also be disrupted by rotation in darkness, suggesting that consolidation had not taken place; however, after learning had continued for 3 d, expression of the learned change was diminished only slightly by blockade and was unaffected by rotation in darkness. Our interpretation of these results is that learning may take place initially in the cerebellar cortex and that during consolidation, motor memories are converted to a more distributed representation that includes the cerebellar cortex and another site.},

abstract = {While the cerebellum's role in motor function is well recognized, the nature of its concurrent role in cognitive function remains considerably less clear. The current consensus paper gathers diverse views on a variety of important roles played by the cerebellum across a range of cognitive and emotional functions. This paper considers the cerebellum in relation to neurocognitive development, language function, working memory, executive function, and the development of cerebellar internal control models and reflects upon some of the ways in which better understanding the cerebellum's status as a "supervised learning machine" can enrich our ability to understand human function and adaptation. As all contributors agree that the cerebellum plays a role in cognition, there is also an agreement that this conclusion remains highly inferential. Many conclusions about the role of the cerebellum in cognition originate from applying known information about cerebellar contributions to the coordination and quality of movement. These inferences are based on the uniformity of the cerebellum's compositional infrastructure and its apparent modular organization. There is considerable support for this view, based upon observations of patients with pathology within the cerebellum.},

abstract = {GABAergic projection neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CN) innervate the inferior olive (IO) that in turn is the source of climbing fibers targeting Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Anatomical evidence suggests that CN synapses modulate electrical coupling between IO neurons. Invivo studies indicate that they are also involved in controlling synchrony and rhythmicity of IO neurons. Here, we demonstrate using virally targeted channelrhodopsin in the cerebellar nucleo-olivary neurons that synaptic input can indeed modulate both the strength and symmetry of electrical coupling between IO neurons and alter network activity. Similar synaptic modifications of electrical coupling are likely to occur in other brain regions, where rapid modification of the spatiotemporal features of the coupled networks is needed to adequately respond to behavioral demands. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The investigated control problem is stabilization of the visual image in response to disturbances. This is analogous to the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) in humans. The cerebellar model is structurally based on the adaptive filter, and the learning rule is computationally analogous to least-mean squares, where parameter adaptation at the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse is driven by the correlation of the sensory error signal (carried by the climbing fiber) and the motor command signal. Convergence of the algorithm is first analyzed in simulation on a model of the robot and then tested online in both one and two degrees of freedom. The results show that this model of neural function successfully works on a real-world problem, providing empirical evidence for validating: 1) the generic cerebellar learning algorithm; 2) the function of the cerebellum in the VOR; and 3) the signal transmission between functional neural components of the VOR.},

The olivo-cerebellar loop, denoting the connections between the Cerebellar cortex, Inferior Olive and Cerebellar Nuclei (CN), is also modularly organized to form what is known as the cerebellar module. In contrast to the relatively organized and static anatomy, the cerebellum is innervated by a wide variety of neuromodulator carrying axons that are heterogeneously distributed along the olivo-cerebellar loop, providing heterogeneity to the static structure. In this manuscript we review modulatory processes in the olivo-cerebellar loop. We start by discussing the relationship between neuromodulators and the animal behavioral states. This is followed with an overview of the cerebellar neuromodulatory signals and a short discussion of why and when the cerebellar activity should be modulated. We then devote a section for three types of neurons where we briefly review its properties and propose possible neuromodulation scenarios.},

@article{Lisberger2009a,
abstract = {Internal models are a key feature of most modern theories of motor control. Yet, it has been challenging to localize internal models in the brain, or to demonstrate that they are more than a metaphor. In the present review, I consider a large body of data on the cerebellar floccular complex, asking whether floccular output has features that would be expected of the output from internal models. I argue that the simple spike firing rates of a single group of floccular Purkinje cells could reflect the output of three different internal models. (1) An eye velocity positive feedback pathway through the floccular complex provides neural inertia for smooth pursuit eye movements, and appears to operate as a model of the inertia of real-world objects. (2) The floccular complex processes and combines input signals so that the dynamics of its average simple spike output are appropriate for the dynamics of the downstream brainstem circuits and eyeball. If we consider the brainstem circuits and eyeball as a more broadly conceived "oculomotor plant," then the output from the floccular complex could be the manifestation of an inverse model of "plant" dynamics. (3) Floccular output reflects an internal model of the physics of the orbit where head and eye motion sum to produce gaze motion. The effects of learning on floccular output suggest that it is modeling the interaction of the visually-guided and vestibular-driven components of eye and gaze motion. Perhaps the insights from studying oculomotor control provide groundwork to guide the analysis of internal models for a wide variety of cerebellar behaviors.},

Based on more recent data, however, it has been suggested that changes in Purkinje cell activity do not contribute to the motor command directly; instead, they are used either as a teaching signal, or to predict the altered kinematics of the movement after calibration has taken place. I will argue that these roles are not mutually exclusive, and that Purkinje cells may contribute to command generation, teaching, and prediction at different times during sensori-motor calibration.},

abstract = {A fundamental tenet of cerebellar learning theories asserts that climbing fibre afferents from the inferior olive provide a teaching signal that promotes the gradual adaptation of movements. Data from several forms of motor learning provide support for this tenet. In pavlovian eyelid conditioning, for example, where a tone is repeatedly paired with a reinforcing unconditioned stimulus like periorbital stimulation, the unconditioned stimulus promotes acquisition of conditioned eyelid responses by activating climbing fibres. Climbing fibre activity elicited by an unconditioned stimulus is inhibited during the expression of conditioned responses-consistent with the inhibitory projection from the cerebellum to inferior olive. Here, we show that inhibition of climbing fibres serves as a teaching signal for extinction, where learning not to respond is signalled by presenting a tone without the unconditioned stimulus. We used reversible infusion of synaptic receptor antagonists to show that blocking inhibitory input to the climbing fibres prevents extinction of the conditioned response, whereas blocking excitatory input induces extinction. These results, combined with analysis of climbing fibre activity in a computer simulation of the cerebellar-olivary system, suggest that transient inhibition of climbing fibres below their background level is the signal that drives extinction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain adaptation, a longstanding experimental model of cerebellar learning, utilizes sites of plasticity in both cerebellar cortex and brainstem. However, the mechanisms by which the activity of cortical Purkinje cells may guide synaptic plasticity in brainstem vestibular neurons are unclear. Theoretical analyses indicate that vestibular plasticity should depend upon the correlation between Purkinje cell and vestibular afferent inputs, so that, in gain-down learning for example, increased cortical activity should induce long-term depression (LTD) at vestibular synapses.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we expressed this correlational learning rule in its simplest form, as an anti-Hebbian, heterosynaptic spike-timing dependent plasticity interaction between excitatory (vestibular) and inhibitory (floccular) inputs converging on medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons (input-spike-timing dependent plasticity, iSTDP). To test this rule, we stimulated vestibular afferents to evoke EPSCs in rat MVN neurons in vitro. Control EPSC recordings were followed by an induction protocol where membrane hyperpolarizing pulses, mimicking IPSPs evoked by flocculus inputs, were paired with single vestibular nerve stimuli. A robust LTD developed at vestibular synapses when the afferent EPSPs coincided with membrane hyperpolarization, while EPSPs occurring before or after the simulated IPSPs induced no lasting change. Furthermore, the iSTDP rule also successfully predicted the effects of a complex protocol using EPSP trains designed to mimic classical conditioning.

CONCLUSIONS: These results, in strong support of theoretical predictions, suggest that the cerebellum alters the strength of vestibular synapses on MVN neurons through hetero-synaptic, anti-Hebbian iSTDP. Since the iSTDP rule does not depend on post-synaptic firing, it suggests a possible mechanism for VOR adaptation without compromising gaze-holding and VOR performance in vivo.},

Here, we provide evidence that SLRs unmasked by cerebellar cortex lesions are mediated by an associative form of learning-induced plasticity in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) of the cerebellum. We used pharmacological inactivation and/or electrical microstimulation of various sites afferent and efferent to the AIN to systematically eliminate alternative candidate sites of plasticity upstream or downstream from this structure. Collectively, the results suggest that cerebellar learning is mediated in part by plasticity in target nuclei downstream of the cerebellar cortex. These data demonstrate an instance in which an aspect of associative learning, SLRs, can be used as an index of plasticity at a specific site in the brain.},

abstract = {Computational analysis of neural systems is at its most useful when it uncovers principles that provide a unified account of phenomena across multiple scales and levels of description. Here we analyse a widely used model of the cerebellar contribution to sensori-motor learning to demonstrate both that its response to intrinsic and sensor noise is optimal, and that the unexpected synaptic and behavioural consequences of this optimality can explain a wide range of experimental data. The response of the Marr-Albus adaptive-filter model of the cerebellar microcircuit to noise was examined in the context of vestibulo-ocular reflex calibration. We found that, when appropriately connected, an adaptive-filter model using the covariance learning rule to adjust the weights of synapses between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells learns weight values that are optimal given the relative amount of signal and noise carried by each parallel fibre. This optimality principle is consistent with data on the cerebellar role in smooth pursuit eye movements, and predicts that many synaptic weights must be very small, providing an explanation for the experimentally observed preponderance of silent synapses. Such a preponderance has in its turn two further consequences. First, an additional inhibitory pathway from parallel fibre to Purkinje cell is required if Purkinje cell activity is to be altered in either direction from a starting point of silent synapses. Second, cerebellar learning tasks must often proceed via LTP, rather than LTD as is widely assumed. Taken together, these considerations have profound behavioural consequences, including the optimal combination of sensori-motor information, and asymmetry and hysteresis of sensori-motor learning rates.},

abstract = {Classical Marr-Albus theories of cerebellar learning employ only cortical sites of plasticity. However, tests of these theories using adaptive calibration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) have indicated plasticity in both cerebellar cortex and the brainstem. To resolve this long-standing conflict, we attempted to identify the computational role of the brainstem site, by using an adaptive filter version of the cerebellar microcircuit to model VOR calibration for changes in the oculomotor plant. With only cortical plasticity, introducing a realistic delay in the retinal-slip error signal of 100 ms prevented learning at frequencies higher than 2.5 Hz, although the VOR itself is accurate up to at least 25 Hz. However, the introduction of an additional brainstem site of plasticity, driven by the correlation between cerebellar and vestibular inputs, overcame the 2.5 Hz limitation and allowed learning of accurate high-frequency gains. This "cortex-first" learning mechanism is consistent with a wide variety of evidence concerning the role of the flocculus in VOR calibration, and complements rather than replaces the previously proposed "brainstem-first" mechanism that operates when ocular tracking mechanisms are effective. These results (i) describe a process whereby information originally learnt in one area of the brain (cerebellar cortex) can be transferred and expressed in another (brainstem), and (ii) indicate for the first time why a brainstem site of plasticity is actually required by Marr-Albus type models when high-frequency gains must be learned in the presence of error delay.},

abstract = {Current views of cerebellar function have been heavily influenced by the models of Marr and Albus, who suggested that the climbing fibre input to the cerebellum acts as a teaching signal for motor learning. It is commonly assumed that this teaching signal must be motor error (the difference between actual and correct motor command), but this approach requires complex neural structures to estimate unobservable motor error from its observed sensory consequences. We have proposed elsewhere a recurrent decorrelation control architecture in which Marr-Albus models learn without requiring motor error. Here, we prove convergence for this architecture and demonstrate important advantages for the modular control of systems with multiple degrees of freedom. These results are illustrated by modelling adaptive plant compensation for the three-dimensional vestibular ocular reflex. This provides a functional role for recurrent cerebellar connectivity, which may be a generic anatomical feature of projections between regions of cerebral and cerebellar cortex.},

Each cell type within the cerebellar cortex is organized into an exquisite map; molecular expression patterns, dendrite projections, and axon terminal fields divide the medial-lateral axis of the cerebellum into topographic sagittal zones. Here, we discuss the mechanisms that establish zones and highlight how gene expression and neural activity contribute to cerebellar pattern formation. We focus on the olivocerebellar system because its developmental mechanisms are becoming clear, its topographic termination patterns are very precise, and its contribution to zonal function is debated. This review deconstructs the architecture and development of the olivocerebellar pathway to provide an update on how brain circuit maps form and function.},

abstract = {The modular concept of cerebellar connections has been advocated in the lifetime work of Jan Voogd. In this concept, a cerebellar module is defined as the conglomerate of one or multiple and non-adjacent, parasagittally arranged zones of Purkinje cells, their specific projection to a well-defined region of the cerebellar nuclei, and the climbing fiber input to these zones by a well-defined region of the inferior olivary complex. The modular organization of these olivo-cortico-nuclear connections is further exemplified by matching reciprocal connections between inferior olive and cerebellar nuclei. Because the different regions of the cerebellar nuclei show highly specific output patterns, cerebellar modules have been suggested to constitute functional entities. This idea is strengthened by the observation that anatomically defined modules adhere to the distribution of chemical markers in the cerebellar cortex suggesting that modules not only differ in their input and output relations but also may differ in operational capabilities. Here, I will briefly review some recent data on the establishment of cerebellar modules in rats. Furthermore, some evidence will be shown suggesting that the other main afferent system (i.e., mossy fibers), at least to some extent, also adheres to the modular organization. Finally, using retrograde transneuronal tracing with rabies virus, some evidence will be provided that several cerebellar modules may be involved in the control of individual muscles.},

Studies have provided supportive evidence for a potential role of kinase-mediated long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse in cerebellar learning. Recently, phosphatases have been implicated in the induction of potentiation of Purkinje cell activities in vitro, but it remains to be shown whether and how phosphatase-mediated potentiation contributes to motor learning. Here, we investigated its possible role by creating and testing a Purkinje cell-specific knockout of calcium/calmodulin-activated protein-phosphatase-2B (L7-PP2B). The selective deletion of PP2B indeed abolished postsynaptic long-term potentiation in Purkinje cells and their ability to increase their excitability, whereas LTD was unaffected. The mutants showed impaired "gain-decrease" and "gain-increase" adaptation of their vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) as well as impaired acquisition of classical delay conditioning of their eyeblink response. Thus, our data indicate that PP2B may indeed mediate potentiation in Purkinje cells and contribute prominently to cerebellar motor learning.},

We now disrupted the Kcc2 K-Cl cotransporter specifically in either cell type to manipulate their excitability and inhibition by GABA(A)-receptor Cl(-) channels. Although Kcc2 may have a morphogenic role in synapse development, Kcc2 disruption neither changed synapse density nor spine morphology. In both GCs and PCs, disruption of Kcc2, but not Kcc3, increased [Cl(-)](i) roughly two-fold. The reduced Cl(-) gradient nearly abolished GABA-induced hyperpolarization in PCs, but in GCs it merely affected excitability by membrane depolarization. Ablation of Kcc2 from GCs impaired consolidation of long-term phase learning of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, whereas baseline performance, short-term gain-decrease learning and gain consolidation remained intact.

abstract = {The cerebellum influences behavior and cognition exclusively via Purkinje cell synapses onto neurons in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. In contrast with the rich information available about the organization of the cerebellar cortex and its synaptic inputs, relatively little is known about microcircuitry postsynaptic to Purkinje cells. Here we examined the cell types and microcircuits through which Purkinje cells influence an oculomotor behavior controlled by the cerebellum, the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex, which involves only two eye muscles. Using a combination of anatomical tracing and electrophysiological recordings in transgenic mouse lines, we identified several classes of neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus that receive Purkinje cell synapses from the cerebellar flocculus. Glycinergic and glutamatergic flocculus target neurons (FTNs) with somata densely surrounded by Purkinje cell terminals projected axons to the ipsilateral abducens and oculomotor nuclei, respectively. Of three additional types of FTNs that were sparsely innervated by Purkinje cells, glutamatergic and glycinergic neurons projected to the contralateral and ipsilateral abducens, respectively, and GABAergic neurons projected to contralateral vestibular nuclei. Densely innervated FTNs had high spontaneous firing rates and pronounced postinhibitory rebound firing, and were physiologically homogeneous, whereas the intrinsic excitability of sparsely innervated FTNs varied widely. Heterogeneity in the molecular expression, physiological properties, and postsynaptic targets of FTNs implies that Purkinje cell activity influences the neural control of eye movements in several distinct ways. These results indicate that the cerebellum regulates a simple reflex behavior via at least five different cell types that are postsynaptic to Purkinje cells.},

abstract = {Adaptation of ocular reflexes is a prototype of motor learning. While the cerebellum is acknowledged as the critical site for motor learning, the functional differences between the cerebellar cortex and nuclei in motor memory formation are not precisely known. Two different views are proposed: one that the memory is formed within the cerebellar flocculus, and the other that the memory is formed within vestibular nuclei. Here we developed a new paradigm of long-term adaptation of mouse horizontal optokinetic response eye movements and examined the location of its memory trace. We also tested the role of flocculus and inferior olive in long-term adaptation by chronic lesion experiments. Reversible bilateral flocculus shutdown with local application of 0.5 ??l-5\% lidocaine extinguished the memory trace of day-long adaptation, while it very little affected the memory trace of week-long adaptation. The responsiveness of vestibular nuclei after week-long adaptation was examined by measuring the extracellular field responses to the electrical stimulation of vestibular nerve under trichloroacetaldehyde anesthesia. The amplitudes and slopes of evoked monosynaptic field response (N1) of week-long adapted mice were enhanced around the medial vestibular nucleus compared with those of control mice. Chronic flocculus or inferior olive lesions abolished both day and week-long adaptations. These results suggest that the functional memory trace of short-term adaptation is formed initially within the cerebellar cortex, and later transferred to vestibular nuclei to be consolidated to a long-term memory. Both day and week-long adaptations were markedly depressed when neural nitric oxide was pharmacologically blocked locally and when neuronal nitric oxide synthase was ablated by gene knockout, suggesting that cerebellar long-term depression underlies both acquisition and consolidation of motor memory. ?? 2005 IBRO.},

abstract = {Multiple processes may contribute to motor skill acquisition, but it is thought that many of these processes require sleep or the passage of long periods of time ranging from several hours to many days or weeks. Here we demonstrate that within a timescale of minutes, two distinct fast-acting processes drive motor adaptation. One process responds weakly to error but retains information well, whereas the other responds strongly but has poor retention. This two-state learning system makes the surprising prediction of spontaneous recovery (or adaptation rebound) if error feedback is clamped at zero following an adaptation-extinction training episode. We used a novel paradigm to experimentally confirm this prediction in human motor learning of reaching, and we show that the interaction between the learning processes in this simple two-state system provides a unifying explanation for several different, apparently unrelated, phenomena in motor adaptation including savings, anterograde interference, spontaneous recovery, and rapid unlearning. Our results suggest that motor adaptation depends on at least two distinct neural systems that have different sensitivity to error and retain information at different rates.},

abstract = {Brain stem signals that generate saccadic eye movements originate in the superior colliculus. They reach the pontine burst generator for horizontal saccades via short-latency pathways and a longer pathway through the oculomotor vermis (OMV) of the cerebellum. Lesion studies implicate the OMV in the adaptation of saccade amplitude that occurs when saccades become inaccurate because of extraocular muscle weakness or behavioral manipulations. We studied the nature of the possible error signal that might drive adaptation by examining the complex spike (CS) activity of vermis Purkinje (P-) cells in monkeys. We produced a saccade error by displacing the target as a saccade was made toward it; a corrective saccade approximately 200 ms later eliminated the resulting error. In most P-cells, the probability of CS firing changed, but only in the error interval between the primary and corrective saccade. For most P-cells, CSs occurred in a tight cluster approximately 100 ms after error onset. The probability of CS occurrence depended on both error direction and size. Across our sample, all error directions were represented; most had a horizontal component. In more than one half of our P-cells, the probability of CS occurrence was greatest for error sizes<5 degrees and less for larger errors. In the remaining cells, there was a uniform increased probability of CS occurrence for all errors<or=7-9 degrees. CS responses disappeared when the target was extinguished during a saccade. We discuss the properties of this putative CS error signal in the context of the characteristics of saccade adaptation produced by the target displacement paradigm.},

abstract = {The way the cerebellar granular layer transforms incoming mossy fiber signals into new spike patterns to be related to Purkinje cells is not yet clear. Here, a realistic computational model of the granular layer was developed and used to address four main functional hypotheses: center-surround organization, time-windowing, high-pass filtering in responses to spike bursts and coherent oscillations in response to diffuse random activity. The model network was activated using patterns inspired by those recorded in vivo. Burst stimulation of a small mossy fiber bundle resulted in granule cell bursts delimited in time (time windowing) and space (center-surround) by network inhibition. This burst-burst transmission showed marked frequency-dependence configuring a high-pass filter with cut-off frequency around 100 Hz. The contrast between center and surround properties was regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance. The stronger excitation made the center more responsive to 10-50 Hz input frequencies and enhanced the granule cell output (with spikes occurring earlier and with higher frequency and number) compared to the surround. Finally, over a certain level of mossy fiber background activity, the circuit generated coherent oscillations in the theta-frequency band. All these processes were fine-tuned by NMDA and GABA-A receptor activation and neurotransmitter vesicle cycling in the cerebellar glomeruli. This model shows that available knowledge on cellular mechanisms is sufficient to unify the main functional hypotheses on the cerebellum granular layer and suggests that this network can behave as an adaptable spatio-temporal filter coordinated by theta-frequency oscillations.},

abstract = {Stimulation around the superior cerebellar peduncle or within the deep cerebellar nuclei is known to inhibit the inferior olive with a very long latency. It has been suggested that this inhibition is mediated by the GABA-ergic nucleo-olivary pathway, but alternative explanations such as activation of an indirect excitatory pathway or a pathway via the red nucleus are possible. A long-latency inhibition via the nucleo-olivary pathway would have profound implications for cerebellar function and the present study was performed to test alternative explanations and to characterize the nucleo-olivary inhibition. Climbing fibre responses (CFRs), evoked by periorbital stimulation and recorded from the cerebellar cortex, could be inhibited by stimulation of two distinct mesencephalic areas. One was located within the superior cerebellar peduncle and the other about 1 mm further ventrally. Inhibition evoked from either area occurred in the inferior olive and was independent of a red nucleus relay. Single Purkinje cell recordings revealed that inhibition from the ventral area was not secondary to olivary activation. It is concluded that stimulation of the ventral area activated nucleo-olivary fibres. The inhibition elicited by stimulation within the peduncle probably resulted from indirect activation on the nucleo-olivary fibres via antidromic activation of the interpositus nucleus. The time courses of the inhibition from the two areas were indistinguishable. The duration of the strongest inhibition was short and had a sharp peak at about 30 ms. It is suggested that the time course of the inhibition is important for temporal regulation of learned responses.},

abstract = {The microcircuitry of cerebellar cortex and, in particular, the physiology of its main element, the Purkinje neuron, has been extensively investigated and described. However, activity in Purkinje neurons, either as single cells or populations, does not directly mediate the cerebellar effects on the motor effector systems. Rather, the result of the entire cerebellar cortical computation is passed to the relatively small cerebellar nuclei that act as the final, integrative processing unit in the cerebellar circuitry. The nuclei ultimately control the temporal and spatial features of the cerebellar output. Given this key role, it is striking that the internal organization and the connectivity with afferent and efferent pathways in the cerebellar nuclei are rather poorly known. In the present review, we discuss some of the many critical shortcomings in the understanding of cerebellar nuclei microcircuitry: the extent of convergence and divergence of the cerebellar cortical pathway to the various cerebellar nuclei neurons and subareas, the possible (lack of) conservation of the finely-divided topographical organization in the cerebellar cortex at the level of the nuclei, as well as the absence of knowledge of the synaptic circuitry within the cerebellar nuclei. All these issues are important for predicting the pattern-extraction and encoding capabilities of the cerebellar nuclei and, until resolved, theories and models of cerebellar motor control and learning may err considerably.},

abstract = {The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) integrate inputs from the brain stem, the inferior olive, and the spinal cord with Purkinje cell output from cerebellar cortex and provide the major output of the cerebellum. Despite their crucial function in motor control and learning, the various populations of neurons in the DCN are poorly defined and characterized. Importantly, differences in electrophysiological properties between glutamatergic and GABAergic cells of the DCN have been largely elusive. Here, we used glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 67-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice to unambiguously identify GABAergic (GAD-positive) and non-GABAergic (GAD-negative, most likely glutamatergic) neurons of the DCN. Morphological analysis of DCN neurons patch-clamped with biocytin-containing electrodes revealed a significant overlap in the distributions of the soma sizes of GAD-positive and GAD-negative cells. Compared with GAD-negative DCN neurons, GAD-positive DCN neurons fire broader action potentials, display stronger frequency accommodation, and do not reach as high firing frequencies during depolarizing current injections. Furthermore, GAD-positive cells display slower spontaneous firing rates and have a more shallow frequency-to-current relationship than the GAD-negative cells but exhibit a longer-lasting rebound depolarization and associated spiking after a transient hyperpolarization. In contrast to the rather homogeneous population of GAD-positive cells, the GAD-negative cells were found to consist of two distinct populations as defined by cell size and electrophysiological features. We conclude that GABAergic DCN neurons are specialized to convey phasic spike rate information, whereas tonic spike rate is more faithfully relayed by the large non-GABAergic cells.},

Despite this deficit, their eye movement performance as well as their general motor behaviour appears unaffected. This combination suggests that, in the long term, residual forms of plasticity in the vestibulo-cerebellar circuitry can compensate for the absence of cerebellar LTD. To investigate whether LTD-deficient mice exhibit motor learning in the long run, we subjected L7-PKCi transgenic mice to visuo-vestibular training paradigms that were aimed at either increasing or decreasing the VOR response in the course of eight consecutive days. During the increasing paradigm, the VOR gain of transgenic mice increased significantly, while VOR gain decreased and VOR phase-lead increased during the decreasing paradigm. The impact of these long training periods on the VOR was significantly smaller in LTD-deficient mice than in wild type littermates. Thus, while LTD may be necessary for short-term VOR adaptation, it facilitates but is not required for long-term adaptation of the VOR.},

abstract = {Many forms of learning require temporally ordered stimuli. In Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS) must precede the unconditioned stimulus (US) by at least about 100 ms for learning to occur. Conditioned responses are learned and generated by the cerebellum. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex during conditioning have revealed CS-triggered pauses in the firing of Purkinje cells that likely drive the conditioned blinks. The predominant view of the learning mechanism in conditioning is that long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell synapses underlies the Purkinje cell pauses. This raises a serious conceptual challenge because LTD is most effectively induced at short CS-US intervals, which do not support acquisition of eyeblinks. To resolve this discrepancy, we recorded Purkinje cells during conditioning with short or long CS-US intervals. Decerebrated ferrets trained with CS-US intervals â¥150 ms reliably developed Purkinje cell pauses, but training with an interval of 50 ms unexpectedly induced increases in CS-evoked spiking. This bidirectional modulation of Purkinje cell activity offers a basis for the requirement of a minimum CS-US interval for conditioning, but we argue that it cannot be fully explained by LTD, even when previous in vitro studies of stimulus-timing-dependent LTD are taken into account.},

@article{Wulff2009a,
abstract = {Although feedforward inhibition onto Purkinje cells was first documented 40 years ago, we understand little of how inhibitory interneurons contribute to cerebellar function in behaving animals. Using a mouse line (PC-Deltagamma2) in which GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition is selectively removed from Purkinje cells, we examined how feedforward inhibition from molecular layer interneurons regulates adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Although impairment of baseline motor performance was relatively mild, the ability to adapt the phase of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and to consolidate gain adaptations was strongly compromised. Purkinje cells showed abnormal patterns of simple spikes, both during and in the absence of evoked compensatory eye movements. On the basis of modeling our experimental data, we propose that feedforward inhibition, by controlling the fine-scale patterns of Purkinje cell activity, enables the induction of plasticity in neurons of the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei.},

@article{Yamazaki2007,
abstract = {We examined closely the cerebellar circuit model that we have proposed previously. The model granular layer generates a finite but very long sequence of active neuron populations without recurrence, which is able to represent the passage of time. For all the possible binary patterns fed into mossy fibres, the circuit generates the same number of different sequences of active neuron populations. Model Purkinje cells that receive parallel fiber inputs from neurons in the granular layer learn to stop eliciting spikes at the timing instructed by the arrival of signals from the inferior olive. These functional roles of the granular layer and Purkinje cells are regarded as a liquid state generator and readout neurons, respectively. Thus, the cerebellum that has been considered to date as a biological counterpart of a perceptron is reinterpreted to be a liquid state machine that possesses powerful information processing capability more than a perceptron. ?? 2007.},
