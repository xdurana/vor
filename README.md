### Wulff experiment

This is a phase-reversal VOR adaptation experiment. It consists of 9 sessions: 5 training sessions and 4 light deprivation sessions. Gain 1 is defined as the amplitude at the end of the second session.

1. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain 1
2. 2 sessions of 1440-cycles of light deprivation
3. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain 0
4. 1440-cycles of light deprivation
5. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain -0.5
6. 1440-cycles of light deprivation
7. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain -1
8. 1440-cycles of light deprivation
9. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain -1

### VOR cancellation experiment with long period of light deprivation

This is a VOR cancellation adaptation experiment. It consists of 4 sessions: 2 training sessions and 2 light deprivation sessions. The last light deprivation session is much longer than the first one. Gain 1 is defined as the amplitude at the end of the second session.

1. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain 1
2. 2 sessions of 1440-cycles of light deprivation
3. 50-cycles training session with light and target gain 0
4. 7 sessions of 1440-cycles of light deprivation

### VOR cancellation experiment with a longer period of light deprivation

This is like the previous VOR cancellation adaptation experiment but with a longer training and light deprivation periods.

1. 7 sessions of 50-cycle training with light and target gain 1
2. 7 sessions of 1440-cycles of light deprivation
3. 7 sessions of 50-cycle training with light and target gain 0
4. 7 sessions of 1440-cycles of light deprivation
