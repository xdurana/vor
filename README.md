### Wulff experiment

This is a phase-reversal VOR adaptation experiment. It consists of 9 sessions: 5 training sessions and 4 light deprivation sessions. Gain 1 is defined as the amplitude at the end of the second session.

1. 50 minutes training session with light and target gain 1
2. 2 sessions of 1440 minutes of light deprivation
3. 50 minutes training session with light and target gain 0
4. 1440 minutes of light deprivation
5. 50 minutes training session with light and target gain -0.5
6. 1440 minutes of light deprivation
7. 50 minutes training session with light and target gain -1
8. 1440 minutes of light deprivation
9. 50 minutes training session with light and target gain -1
