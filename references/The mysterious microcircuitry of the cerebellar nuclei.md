Uusisaari, M., & De Schutter, E. (2011). The mysterious microcircuitry of the cerebellar nuclei. The Journal of Physiology, 589(Pt 14), 3441–3457. http://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201582

Activity in Purkinje neurons, either as single cells or populations, does not directly mediate the cerebellar effects on the motor effector systems. Rather, the result of the entire cerebellar cortical computation is passed to the relatively small cerebellar nuclei that act as the final, integrative processing unit in the cerebellar circuitry.

The internal organization and the connectivity with afferent and efferent pathways in the cerebellar nuclei are rather poorly known.

These issues are important for predicting the pattern-extraction and encoding capabilities of the cerebellar nuclei and, until resolved, theories and models of cerebellar motor control and learning may err considerably.

Even though the VN are often thought to be ‘analogous’ to the CN, the VN neurons targeted by PNs do not inhibit the IO (Sekirnjak et al. 2003), clearly placing them outside of the OCNO loops.

The floccular cerebellum (FC; far right) and the related behavioural function (vestibulo-ocular reflex) have been the focus of intense study, and features described in this system (such as conservation of OCNO pathway on a single-cell level) have been thought to generalize to the entire cerebellum. However, the connections of the vestibulocerebellum (incorporating the floccular cerebellar cortex, the ventralmost part of the lateral CN, and specific regions of the contralateral IO, the ventrolateral olive and dorsal cap of Kooy) to the CN exhibit many structural differences compared to those from the cerebellar hemispheres.
Most strikingly, the olivo-nuclear CF collaterals and PN axons in the FC target an area in the CN that has significantly fewer large glutamatergic projection neurons than the rest of the CN, and part of the FC signalling to its extracerebellar targets (the oculomotor nuclei) is conveyed via the projection neurons within the vestibular nuclei (VN) that are outside the OCNO loop.

Unfortunately, even though the presence of PN terminals on NO neurons is unquestionable, there are no published reports of inhibitory effects of PN input to these cells that would allow the formation of a clear hypothesis on how PN spike patterns influence NO neuronactivity.

In addition to being modulated by the inhibitory PN synapses, the firing of NO neurons is also likely to be modulated by the excitatory and at least partly reciprocally arranged olivary climbing fibre collaterals.

This pathway may form a negative feedback loop for synchronous IO activity. However, since nothing is known of the physio-logy of the olivo-nuclear pathway – synaptic responses to IO stimulation in NO neurons have not even been shown – this proposal remains speculative. The CF collateral feedback may have a stronger role in cerebellar computations related to vestibulo-ocular functions.

The extent of possible complementary MF collateral innervation ofNO neurons is presently unclear. The terminal targets ofMFs in both cerebellar cortex and CN seem to be roughly linked to the topographically conserved corticonuclear projection (Shinoda et al. 2000), and thus convergence of cortical and nuclear MF pathways on single NO neurons would be anatomically possible. Currently the existence of MF collateral synapses on NO neurons remains to be demonstrated.
